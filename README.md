### NPM

In most cases, it should be as simple as running the following in your project:

## Getting Help

### Script Tag

To install the SDK as a script tag, add the following line to the `<head>` tag of your site on any pages you plan 
to use the SDK to personalize or track events. Next, replace the `<APP_ID>` placeholder with the respective 
application's public ID.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.croct.io/js/v1/lib/plug.js?appId=<APP_ID>"></script>
```
