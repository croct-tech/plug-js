## isAnonymous

This method checks whether the user is anonymous.

If you want to check if the user is identified, consider using the [`isIdentified`](#isidentified) instead.

### Signature

The `isAnonymous` method has the following signature:

```ts
croct.user.isAnonymous(): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the user is anonymous, `false` otherwise.

## isIdentified

This method checks whether the user is identified.

If you want to check if the user is anonymous, consider using the [`isAnonymous`](#isanonymous) method instead.

### Signature

The `isIdentified` method has the following signature:

```ts
croct.user.isIdentified(): boolean
```

This method returns `true` if the user is identified, `false` otherwise.

## edit

This method creates a patch to apply changes to the user's profile.

These are the currently supported attributes:

| `interests`          | `array`  | Up to 30 strings between 1 and 30 characters long | The demonstrated interests.   |
| `activities`         | `array`  | Up to 30 strings between 1 and 30 characters long | The performed activities.     |
| `custom.*`           | `object` | Up to 10 attributes                               | The map of custom attributes. |

The following restrictions apply to custom attributes:

- Each profile allows up to 10 custom attributes
- Attribute names should be strings up to 20 characters long, starting with a letter or underscore and optionally 
followed by letters, digits, or underscores
- Attributes can be primitives (strings, numbers, booleans, and null) or composites (lists and maps).
- Strings should be up to 100 characters long
- Lists can contain up to 30 elements, including primitives, lists of primitives, or maps of primitives
- Maps can contain up to 30 elements, including primitives, lists of primitives, or maps of primitives
- Map keys should be strings up to 50 characters long
 
We recommend using descriptive names in camel case, like `pets`, `favoriteColor` and, `loyaltyNumber`.  Following these
recommendations will make your custom attributes look like the standard ones, which results in queries with better 
readability.

Notice that the attribute names are case-insensitive, meaning both `loyaltyNumber` and `loyaltynumber` refer to the same 
attribute and could ultimately override each other. 

### Signature

The `edit` method has the following signature:

```ts
croct.user.edit(): Patch
```

The return is a patch for specifying the sequence of operations to apply to the user's profile.
Calling save on the patch will return a [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) 
that resolves to the `userProfileChanged` event after successful transmission.

Refer to the [patch documentation](patch.md) for more details on how patching works.

### Code Sample

Here's a minimal example showing how to edit a user profile:

```js
croct.user.edit()
  .set('company', 'Croct')
  .add('interests', 'JavaScript')
  .add('custom.pets', 'crocodile')
  .save()
```
