# Events

Events represent something that happened and help understanding how a user interacts with your application. Besides
telling the story of what happened during a user’s journey, these events also provide data to enrich the
evaluation context and refine the models that continuously improve user experience.

The SDK tracks most of the general-purpose events automatically for you. All other events depend on your use case, so
it is up to you to decide which events make sense for your application. In the following sections, you will find a
summary of all events available to help you decide which events can benefit your application.

## User Events

The user category has the following events:

### userSignedUp

This event records that a user signed up.

You should track this event when a user signs up for your application.

If the user profile does not exist, the engine will create a new one with the provided information.
This event does not affect existing profiles.

For the personalization engine, the semantics of this event does not encompass the

to call the [`identify`](plug.md#identify) method after the sign-up.

**Note:**

- The `sku` and `productId` do not have to be different. Usually, the `productId` is the internal identifier,
  like `12345`, and the SKU is a public-facing identifier like `SM-124-GREEN`.
- The `displayPrice` is the price the user pays, while the `originalPrice` is usually the regular retail price.
- When you don't specify a value for the `lastUpdateTime` property, the SDK considers the time at which you tracked the
  event as the last update time.

**Note:**

- The `sku` and `productId` do not have to be different. Usually, the `productId` is the internal identifier,
  like `12345`, and the SKU is a public-facing identifier like `SM-124-GREEN`.
- The `displayPrice` is the price the user pays, while the `originalPrice` is usually the regular retail price.
- When you don't specify a value for the `lastUpdateTime` property, the SDK considers the time at which you tracked the
  event as the last update time.

**Note:**

- The `sku` and `productId` do not have to be different. Usually, the `productId` is the internal identifier,
  like `12345`, and the SKU is a public-facing identifier like `SM-124-GREEN`.
- The `displayPrice` is the price the user pays, while the `originalPrice` is usually the regular retail price.
- It may seem unusual to specify the order ID at the start of the checkout process, but some e-commerce platforms
  generate the order ID at the start or even before the process begins.

**Note:**

- The `sku` and `productId` do not have to be different. Usually, the `productId` is the internal identifier,
  like `12345`, and the SKU is a public-facing identifier like `SM-124-GREEN`.
- The `displayPrice` is the price the user pays, while the `originalPrice` is usually the regular retail price.
- The `paymentMethod` property accepts arbitrary values, such as `credit-card`, `credit-balance`,  `visa`, `paypal`
  or `bitcoin`.

This can represent an estimated value or a symbolic value. For example, if the sales team can close 10% of people who sign up for a newsletter, and the average transaction is $500, then a possible value for newsletter sign-ups can be $50 (i.e., 10% of $500).                                                |
