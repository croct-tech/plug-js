## Overview

Plug JS is the easiest way to collect, manage, and consume real-time data to fuel personalized experiences. 
A single line of code gives you a fully-featured devkit for building natively personalized applications.

- **Zero configuration.** No setup steps required.
- **No backend necessary.** Deliver personalized experiences from static sites.
- **Fast queries.** Double-digit millisecond latency for real-time evaluations.
- **Fully extensible API.** Easily add and share new features via plugins.
- **Type-Safe.** Typescript typings included.
- **Playground integration** One-click to connect, no configuration needed.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the Croct SDK: 

### NPM

The recommended way to install the SDK is via [NPM](https://npmjs.com). It pairs nicely with module bundlers such as 
Webpack or Browserify and includes Typescript typings.

In most cases, it should be as simple as running the following in your project:

```sh
npm install @croct/plug
```

Then, call [`croct.plug`](docs/plug.md#plug) passing the App ID to initialize the SDK:

```js
import croct from '@croct/plug';

croct.plug({appId: '<APP_ID>'});
```

### Script Tag

To install the SDK as a script tag, add the following line to the `<head>` tag of your site on any pages you plan to use the SDK to personalize or track events:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.croct.io/js/v1/lib/plug.js?appId=<APP_ID>"></script>
<script>croct.plug();</script>
```

You should replace the `<APP_ID>` placeholder with the respective App ID. For more information about the available options, see [`croct.plug`](docs/plug.md#plug).

## Getting Started

> üèñÔ∏è **Just for your convenience**  
> We will use CodePen throughout the tutorial to let you play with the examples right in your browser.

Follow the steps below to connect the playground with CodePen:

1. [Open the playground](http://play.croct.com/)
2. Click on the _"Don't have an API Key?"_ link to proceed in sandbox mode
3. Enter the URL `https://codepen.io/pen`
4. Click on _"Let's play!"_

<br />

</p>

> üí°Ô∏è **Hint**  
> You will typically use an API key to connect to your development, staging, or production environments in real cases,
> but you can also use a local URL, such as `https://localhost/myapp`.

Now, try evaluating the expression below:

```
user is returning
```

After clicking on the _Evaluate_ button, you will see the result at the bottom of the page, which is either `true` or 
`false` depending on whether it is the first time playing with this example.

Let's now implement our first personalization feature. Click on the three-dots icon on the editor's top right corner 
and select _"Open in CodePen"_. Then, copy the code below and paste into the HTML panel:

```html
<button onclick="hey()">üëã Say hey</button>

<script>  
  function welcome() {
    if (confirm('Welcome! Do you want to take a look at our quick start guide?')) {
      window.open('https://croct.link/plug-js/quick-start');
    }
  }
  
  function welcomeBack() {
    if (confirm('Welcome back! How about joining us on Slack this time?')) {
      window.open('https://croct.link/community');
    }
  }
  
  function hey() {
    croct.evaluate('user is returning')
       .then(returning => returning ? welcomeBack() : welcome()); 
  }
</script>
```

Try clicking _"üëã Say Hey"_, and you should see a personalized greeting.

üéâ **Congratulations!** You have successfully implemented your first personalization feature using Croct. For a more 
in-depth walk-through, check out our [quick start guide](docs/quick-start.md).
